# Vector

This repo is a fork of [vector](https://github.com/vectordotdev/vector) and contains patches carried by Red Hat OpenShift Logging. This is a log collector and forwarder that resides on each OpenShift node to gather application and node logs. Please refer to the [cluster-logging-operator](https://github.com/openshift/cluster-logging-operator) for details regarding the operator that deploys and configures this image. This image is intended to be run in conjunction with the configuration and `run.sh` files provided by the operator. Experiences with the image outside that context may vary.

The `rh-main` branch is empty except for this file.  The branches used by various Red Hat releases are summarized here:
